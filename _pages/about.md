Nice to meet you! I am currently a Ph.D. student at The Ohio State University, advised by Prof. [Xueru Zhang](https://xueruzhang.github.io/). 
Currently, my research interests lie in (large) visual-language models, multi-modal learning, trustworthy AI (fairness and privacy), and distributional shifts.

Prior to that, I received my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science from East China University of Science and Technology in 2021 and had a short-term study at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I was a research assistant at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I gladly worked with Prof. [Yangming Zhou](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=9lhSCdYAAAAJ).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
